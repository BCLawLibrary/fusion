# Fusion
Federated search over faculty members, courses, experiential learning opportunities, and publications.

Relies on jQuery and DataTables (https://datatables.net/).

There are three versions of fusion: a searchable interactive app (fusion.js), a simplified component for use as a component on a webpage (fusionacfac.js) and a static version for use on pages focusing on a single subject (fusion-static.js).
