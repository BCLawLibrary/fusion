# Fusion
Federated search over faculty members, courses, experiential learning opportunities, and publications.

Relies on jQuery and DataTables (https://datatables.net/).

~~There are three versions of fusion: a searchable interactive app (fusion.js), a simplified component for use as a component on a webpage (fusionacfac.js) and a static version for use on pages focusing on a single subject (fusion-static.js).~~

As of 2023, only the searchable interactive web app (fusion.js, on https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/law/academics-faculty/fusion-search.html) and the simplified component for use as a component on a webpage (fusionacfac.js, on https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/law/academics-faculty.html) is live.
