Moving chronologically, we will examine the ways that lawyering changed the law regarding slavery and the way that lawyering changed in response to changes in the law. Throughout, we will attend to the ways in which understanding resistance lawyering in the past can inform our answers to questions about the problems and promises of resistance lawyering in the present.
