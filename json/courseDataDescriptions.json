This course explores the body of theory he pioneered, now called Critical Race Theory (CRT), and some of its many interdisciplinary directions. In it, we will consider the history of race and racial inequality in the United States, in ways which recognize the tendency of both to intersect with other axes of inequality including gender, sexuality, class, and disability. We will also consider the many ways that formal equality under law obscures continuing racial inequality through purported race neutrality. Specifically, we will examine, understand, & theorize how American conceptions of liberalism, with their attendant reliance on individual responsibility and meritocracy, serve as consistent and effective alibis for racial inequality. Finally, we will consider how CRT has been taken up by non-legal disciplines and in popular culture, particularly in ways which allow us to hone strategies for achieving radical equality & social justice by building on the theoretical insights of the past. The major assignment for this writing and discussion driven course will be a substantial, analytic paper which takes the theories that we discuss and applies them to a contemporary or historical problem of formal equality under the law."},

    {"Number":4425,"Title":"Law of Money","Areas1":"Business Law","Areas2":"Corporate & Securities Law","Areas3":"x","Description":"This course is about the law of payments. It can be relevant for almost all lawyers, because a large part of what lawyers do involves 'moving money.' This not only includes specialists who work for banks, credit card companies, and financial institutions. Corporate lawyers close deals with one party sending money to the other. Private and government litigators settle civil and criminal cases for payment of money where the two sides do not trust each other. Family lawyers sometimes have to think about the mechanics of alimony and child support payments. And of course there is payment of a lawyer's own fees. Therefore this is a basic 'primer' course for all lawyers, regardless of prior experience or planned practice area.To understand this topic, we will start with the fundamental concept of money and the rights of sellers, buyers/consumers and banks regarding traditional cash, notes, bank deposits, checks and letters of credit. But the law in this area is also changing rapidly in direct response to new payment-system businesses and consumer transactions arising from the internet and financial technology ('FinTech'). So we will turn to a range of more modern payment systems: wire transfers, credit and debit cards, and electronic banking. Finally, we will use all of these tools to examine emerging legal issues for non-bank mobile payment systems such as Venmo, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and new types of government-issued money that respond to these technologies."},

Students learn about the nature of the modern corporation and its role in politics and in an increasingly globalized marketplace; consumerism and commercialism and the lifestyles they offer; the overriding priority routinely accorded economic growth; social injustice and its links to environmental prospects; the anthropocentric, materialistic, and contempocentric values that currently dominate American culture; and the prospects for a new environmental politics. We will interrogate whether it is desirable and possible to transition to a new economic model where the priority is to sustain human and natural communities, and, if so, what new policies and politics might promote such a transition."},

In this seminar, we will examine the problem from three points of view. First, we will consider the legal context in which racial profiling came to be a constitutionally permissible mode of operation for police officers. In this part of the seminar, students will examine the role of the Supreme Court?s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in abetting racial profiling. Beginning with the Supreme Court?s decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), students will review the cases that have defined the rules of engagement for encounters between the police and the public, paying particular attention to how the application of ostensibly neutral constitutional principles have, over time, validated racial profiling. In the second part of the seminar, students will explore the legal barriers to achieving accountability for racially discriminatory police conduct that results in a deprivation of life or liberty. The last part of the seminar will challenge students to imagine doctrinal changes in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that potentially could nullify the legal significance now accorded to racially motivated police conduct."},

For students desiring to continue their studies of tax, Taxation I develops the themes which will be recurring in later courses and forms the basis on which the subsequent tax courses build."},

After a brief review of the other common forms for organizing a business and their distinctive tax treatments, the course focuses on the most important federal income tax issues relating to the organization, operation, liquidation and reorganization of publicly-traded corporations (and other 'C' corporations). This includes the relationship between corporations and shareholders and the treatment of dividends and redemptions. The course is important for any student thinking of practicing in the general business area, even if she or he does not intend to become a 'tax specialist.'"},

    {"Number":9951,"Title":"Technology Transactions and Licensing","Areas1":"Intellectual Property & Technology Law","Areas2":"Business Law","Areas3":"Intellectual Property & Technology Law","Description":"This course will examine, from both the licensor's and the licensee's perspectives, the legal doctrines and related business concepts surrounding the licensing of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other proprietary rights in technology. Through a combination of case study, problems, simulated negotiations and drafting exercises, students will learn how and why participants in the information economy depend on licensing and related transactions as a vehicle for commercial exploitation of their technology assets and building enterprise value. The course will focus on developing basic, practical negotiating, drafting and analytical skills that students should find useful when advising technology-based clients. Although the course's emphasis on drafting and contract interpretation means it is, in many ways, an advanced contracts course, its reach is much broader and will touch on many other areas of the law."},

It is an exercise in the art of transactional lawyering, using commercial leases in a shopping center as a centerpiece. Through the study of a textbook, cases, statutes, and commercial documents, as well as through drafting and negotiation exercises, everything the student has learned in law school will converge on the problems that fictional clients bring to the class for solution. We will explore the choice of business entity, letters of intent, percentage rent, use restrictions, anti-trust, free speech in the shopping center, restrictions on transfer of interest by landlord and tenant, relationships and contracts with abutters, environmental issues, green leases, defaults and remedies, ethical issues, and bankruptcy.

    {"Number":9155,"Title":"The Cradle to Prison Pipeline","Areas1":"Civil & Human Rights Law","Areas2":"Family & Estate Law;","Areas3":"x","Description":"In 2012, the DOJ's Civil Rights Division formally accused the city of Meridian, Mississippi and the state's departments of youth & human services of operating 'a school-to-prison pipeline'. While it is rare that such explicit practices are alleged, the reality of the school to prison pipeline is well documented. However, the realities of systemic practices & policies that have fueled what Marian Write Edleman & others have characterized as the cradle to prison pipeline are now being scrutinized. The BBA's Cradle to Prison Pipeline Committee describes the process as the mechanism by which disparities in a wide range of arenas--including economic, health care, mental health, housing, child welfare & juvenile justice factors--'funnel' people of color, the poor, the LGBTQ+ community, & youth with disabilities into the system of mass incarceration. 'Unpacking' this phenomena entails examining critical issues of race, class, geographical & educational segregation & implicates consideration of the larger frames that affect families in & out of courtrooms. As Jill Lepore notes in Baby Doe: A Political Tragedy, between 2010-12, 72% of the youth committed to the MA DYS had been involved with DCF & over half of that number has been the subject of abuse & neglect petitions. In exploring this terrain this course will consider the evolution of child welfare & juvenile justice systems, de facto v. de jure segregation & to encourage students to think about ways to chart a different course."},

The course has several objectives: exposing students to fundamental concepts underlying the U.S. legal system, providing survival skills for the LL.M. year, exposing students to key doctrinal areas, and offering a frame of reference for comparing the U.S. legal system with students' own. The course is divided into three units: (a) an overview of our basic legal institutions, including the adversary system, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights; (b) a case study in product liability law, as both substantive exposure to private law and an exercise in identifying and manipulating legal doctrine; and (c) an examination of how the structure of the legal profession and different modes of lawyering contribute to the functioning of the U.S. legal system as a whole."},

    {"Number":7727,"Title":"Whistleblowing and Retaliation","Areas1":"Administrative & Government Law","Areas2":"","Areas3":"x","Description":"The laws relating to whistleblowing have evolved dramatically in the last twenty years. Additionally, whistleblowers in both the private and public sector have increasingly played a more prominent role in influencing social reform and public policy. The courts, legislatures, and government agencies charged with enforcing whistleblower laws have wrestled with the degree to which whistleblowers should be protected from retaliation and under what circumstances they should be incentivized to come forward by the prospect of a monetary award. In the private sector, courts remain divided over the proper balance between whistleblower protection and enforcement of legitimate corporate business interests such as the protection of confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets. In the public sector, challenges abound to balance to competing interests in disclosing alleged wrongdoing while protecting national security. In addition to examining the dramatic evolution of the laws and social policies relating to whistleblowing, this course will also examine the many ethical issues presented such as when and under what circumstances can an attorney present as a whistleblower. Finally, this course will examine best practices from a corporate compliance perspective to foster transparency and to effectively investigate whistleblower claims as they arise."},
